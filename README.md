# Little About Me
- As a software engineer with a background in healthcare administration and computer science, I bring a detail-oriented and self-motivated mindset to what I build. I aim to use creative problem-solving, and cross-functionally collaborating skills as well as multiple software development tools such as HTML, CSS, JS, and MongoDB to create valuable applications. I am dedicated to designing and building websites to improve the way users access information.
